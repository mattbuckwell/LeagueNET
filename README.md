# LeagueNET

NFL Web Application.

## Goal

<p>
Build a complete web application that displays a sports league, complete with teams, players, and sorting and filtering options using ASP.NET and Razor pages through Visual Studios.
</p>

<p>
<strong>This required 2 major additions to the starting template:</strong>
</p>
<p>A page to display the teams, listed by conference and division aswell as allow the user the select a "favourite team" which would be highlighted in gold and saved to the cookie. Selecting a team would redirect the user to a page that displays information about that team aswell as show a picture of the stadium, stadium seating and players attached to that team.
</p>
<p>
A page to display all the players in the league by their TeamId, players were highlighted in gold if they belonged to the "favourite team" selected earlier. The user could refine their search by team or position aswell as search for a player or sort all players by either, name, number or position. Selecting a player would take the user to a page that displays information regarding that player.
